# Step 4: Pythonic Folder Structure and Component Organization

This document explains the rationale and best practices behind the folder structure for orchestration and agent components in a Pythonic multi-agent healthcare backend.

## Orchestration vs. Orchestration Agent Folders

- **orchestration/**: Contains reusable components and utilities for orchestration logic—such as input handlers, task planners, dispatchers, state managers, result aggregators, error handlers, and feedback loops. These are building blocks that can be used by any orchestration agent or even shared across multiple orchestration agents.

- **orchestration_agent/**: Contains the specific implementation of your main orchestration agent. It imports and composes the components from `orchestration/` to create the actual agent that coordinates sub-agents, manages workflows, and exposes API endpoints.

**Why separate them?**
- Separation allows you to reuse orchestration logic for different agents or workflows.
- You can have multiple orchestration agents (e.g., for different domains) that share common orchestration components.
- It keeps your codebase modular, maintainable, and extensible.

**Summary:**
- `orchestration/` = shared orchestration components/utilities
- `orchestration_agent/` = concrete orchestration agent implementation

## Agents vs. Sub-Agents Folders

- **agents/**: This folder lists your concrete agent implementations, such as `disease_prediction` and `patient_journey`. Each agent folder contains the code specific to that agent’s business logic, API endpoints, and integration. These are the actual agents that perform tasks in your system.

- **sub_agents/**: This folder contains reusable component classes (e.g., `TaskHandler`, `DomainLogic`, `APIDataConnector`, etc.) that define common patterns and logic for sub-agents. These components are not tied to any one agent—they are building blocks that can be imported and used by any agent in the `agents/` folder.

**Why this separation?**
- Keeps agent-specific code isolated, making it easier to maintain and extend each agent.
- Promotes code reuse: common logic lives in `sub_agents/` and is shared across all agents.
- Supports scalability: you can add new agents in `agents/` and reuse the same components from `sub_agents/` without duplication.

**Summary:**
- `agents/` = folders for each concrete agent (business logic, API, integration)
- `sub_agents/` = shared, reusable components for agent logic (used by all agents)

## Industry Best Practice

- Organize code by responsibility and domain, using clear, separate folders for orchestration and sub-agents.
- This separation improves maintainability, scalability, and supports unit testing and CI/CD.
- Aligns with microservice and multi-agent design patterns.
- You should keep these folders and import the components into your agent implementations as needed.

## Example Folder Structure

```
python_backend/
├── orchestration/           # Shared orchestration components
├── orchestration_agent/     # Main orchestration agent implementation
├── agents/
│   ├── disease_prediction/  # Disease Prediction Agent
│   └── patient_journey/     # Patient Journey Agent
├── sub_agents/              # Shared sub-agent components
└── ...
```

---

## Summary

This structure is a best practice for modular, maintainable, and scalable multi-agent systems. It allows for easy extension, code reuse, and clear separation of concerns.
