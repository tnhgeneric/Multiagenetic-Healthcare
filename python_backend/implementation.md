### Tech Stack Mapping
- **FastAPI**: For all Python APIs (orchestration agent, sub-agents)
- **LangChain, Vertex AI**: LLM integration (in orchestration_agent)
- **Neo4j**: Ontology/graph database (ontology/)
- **Firebase Firestore/Realtime DB**: For patient data, notifications (integrated in agents)
- **React Native + NX**: Mobile frontend (not shown above, but would be in a separate folder/repo)
- **Spring Boot**: Optional Java backend services (not shown above)
- **CI/CD, Monitoring**: GitHub Actions, Firebase Hosting, Stackdriver/Sentry (infrastructure, not code)

This structure is modular, beginner-friendly, and makes it easy to extend the system with new agents, data sources, or services.

## What is Pythonic Software Architecture?

A "Pythonic" software architecture means designing your codebase and project structure in a way that follows the conventions, best practices, and philosophy of the Python language. This makes your code easier to read, maintain, and extend—especially for teams and beginners. Key aspects include:

- **Modularity:** Break your system into small, focused modules and packages (folders with `__init__.py`). Each module should have a clear responsibility (e.g., input handling, domain logic, data access).
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep different parts of your system (API, business logic, data access, utilities) in separate files or folders. This makes it easier to test and update each part independently.
- **Reusability:** Use functions, classes, and shared modules (like `common/`) to avoid code duplication.
- **Readability:** Write code that is clear and easy to understand. Use meaningful names, type hints, and docstrings. Follow PEP8 style guidelines.
- **Extensibility:** Make it easy to add new features (like new agents or data sources) by following a consistent structure and using interfaces or base classes where appropriate.
- **Configuration and Environment:** Use configuration files (like `.env` or `config.py`) to manage environment-specific settings, rather than hard-coding them.
- **Testing:** Organize tests in a way that mirrors your main code structure, making it easy to test each module in isolation.

## Examples of Pythonic Architecture in This Codebase

Here are some concrete examples from this project that demonstrate Pythonic software architecture:

- **Modularity:**
  - Each major component (orchestration agent, sub-agents, ontology integration, shared utilities) is placed in its own folder/module.
  - Example: The `orchestration_agent/core/` folder contains separate files for input handling, task planning, dispatching, state management, aggregation, error handling, and feedback.

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Business logic for each agent is kept in its own file (e.g., `agents/patient_journey/main.py` for the Patient Journey Agent).
  - The orchestration logic is separated from agent logic, and data access (e.g., Neo4j) is placed in a dedicated `ontology/` module.

- **Reusability:**
  - Shared Pydantic models and utility functions are placed in the `common/` folder, so they can be imported and reused by any part of the system.

- **Readability:**
  - All Python files use clear naming, type hints, and docstrings (see `main.py` and agent files for examples).
  - Example: The `PatientJourneyRequest` and `DiseasePredictionRequest` classes in the agent modules use Pydantic for type-safe, self-documenting data models.

- **Extensibility:**
  - To add a new agent, simply create a new folder in `agents/` and follow the same structure (main.py, domain.py, models.py, etc.).
  - The orchestration agent is designed to dispatch tasks to any number of sub-agents.

- **Configuration and Environment:**
  - (Recommended) Use a `.env` file or a `config.py` for environment-specific settings, such as database URLs or API keys.

- **Testing:**
  - (Recommended) Place your tests in a `tests/` folder, mirroring the main code structure for easy discovery and maintenance.

These patterns make the codebase easy to navigate, understand, and extend—hallmarks of Pythonic architecture.

## Example: Line-by-Line Explanation of `agents/disease_prediction/main.py`

Below is a beginner-friendly, line-by-line explanation of the `main.py` file for the Disease Prediction Agent:

```python
# Disease Prediction Agent (Pythonic skeleton)
```
A comment describing the purpose of this file: it’s a Pythonic template for the Disease Prediction Agent.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional
```
Imports:
- `FastAPI`: The web framework used to create the API.
- `BaseModel`: From Pydantic, used for data validation and serialization.
- `List`, `Optional`: Type hints for lists and optional values.

```python
app = FastAPI(title="Disease Prediction Agent API")
```
Creates a FastAPI application instance, naming it for clarity.

```python
class DiseasePredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    symptoms: List[str]
```
Defines a request model using Pydantic. The API expects a JSON object with a list of symptoms (strings).

```python
class DiseasePredictionResult(BaseModel):
    predicted_diseases: List[str]
    confidence: float
```
Defines a result model for predictions: a list of predicted diseases and a confidence score.

```python
class DiseasePredictionResponse(BaseModel):
    result: DiseasePredictionResult
    error: Optional[str] = None
```
Defines the full API response model: it contains a result (the prediction) and an optional error message.

```python
@app.post("/predict_disease", response_model=DiseasePredictionResponse)
def predict_disease(request: DiseasePredictionRequest):
    # Mocked domain logic
    if "fever" in request.symptoms:
        result = DiseasePredictionResult(predicted_diseases=["Flu", "Common Cold"], confidence=0.87)
    else:
        result = DiseasePredictionResult(predicted_diseases=["Unknown"], confidence=0.5)
    return DiseasePredictionResponse(result=result)
```
Defines the API endpoint `/predict_disease`:
- Accepts a POST request with a JSON body matching `DiseasePredictionRequest`.
- If "fever" is in the symptoms, it predicts "Flu" and "Common Cold" with 0.87 confidence.
- Otherwise, it returns "Unknown" with 0.5 confidence.
- Returns a `DiseasePredictionResponse` with the result.

**Summary:**
This file defines a simple, type-safe FastAPI service for disease prediction, using Pythonic best practices: clear models, type hints, and modular logic.

## Orchestration Agent: Core Components and Pythonic Architecture

The orchestration agent is designed using Pythonic software architecture principles, emphasizing modularity, single responsibility, and clear separation of concerns. Each core function of the orchestration workflow is implemented as a separate module (file) under the `core` directory. This makes the codebase easy to maintain, test, and extend.

### Core Component Explanations

- **input_handler.py**  
  Handles and validates the incoming MCP/ACL JSON payload, extracting relevant information for further processing.

- **task_planner.py**  
  Breaks down the plan into actionable tasks, determines dependencies, and sequences agent activations.

- **agent_dispatcher.py**  
  Dispatches tasks to the appropriate sub-agents (e.g., Patient Journey Agent, Disease Prediction Agent) and collects their results.

- **state_manager.py**  
  Maintains workflow context, tracks progress, and stores intermediate results for multi-step or session-based operations.

- **result_aggregator.py**  
  Merges and processes results from sub-agents, preparing a unified response.

- **error_handler.py**  
  Detects and manages errors, handles retries, and escalates issues as needed.

- **feedback_loop.py**  
  Logs outcomes and user/system feedback for continuous improvement and analytics.

### Example: How the Orchestration Agent Uses These Components

Below is a simplified version of the orchestration agent's FastAPI entrypoint (`main.py`). Notice how each core component is instantiated and used in a clear, modular workflow:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from .core.input_handler import InputHandler
from .core.task_planner import TaskPlanner
from .core.agent_dispatcher import AgentDispatcher
from .core.state_manager import StateManager
from .core.result_aggregator import ResultAggregator
from .core.error_handler import ErrorHandler
from .core.feedback_loop import FeedbackLoop

app = FastAPI(title="Orchestration Agent API")

# Instantiate core components
input_handler = InputHandler()
task_planner = TaskPlanner()
agent_dispatcher = AgentDispatcher()
state_manager = StateManager()
result_aggregator = ResultAggregator()
error_handler = ErrorHandler()
feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()

@app.post("/orchestrate")
def orchestrate(mcp_acl_json: dict):
    """Main orchestration endpoint."""
    plan = input_handler.handle(mcp_acl_json)
    tasks = task_planner.plan(plan)
    results = agent_dispatcher.dispatch(tasks)
    aggregated = result_aggregator.aggregate(results)
    feedback_loop.log(aggregated)
    return aggregated
```

#### How This Demonstrates Pythonic Architecture

- **Modularity:** Each responsibility (input handling, planning, dispatching, etc.) is encapsulated in its own class and file.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component does one thing well, making the code easier to test and maintain.
- **Explicit Imports:** Dependencies are clearly imported at the top, improving readability.
- **Clear Workflow:** The orchestration endpoint (`orchestrate`) reads like a step-by-step recipe, making the logic easy to follow.
- **Extensibility:** New features or agents can be added by creating new modules or extending existing ones, without disrupting the overall structure.

This approach ensures your orchestration agent is robust, maintainable, and easy for new developers to understand and contribute to.

## Example: Line-by-Line Explanation of `orchestration_agent/main.py`

Below is a beginner-friendly, line-by-line explanation of the `main.py` file for the Orchestration Agent:

```python
# Orchestration Agent FastAPI Entrypoint
from fastapi import FastAPI
from .core.input_handler import InputHandler
from .core.task_planner import TaskPlanner
from .core.agent_dispatcher import AgentDispatcher
from .core.state_manager import StateManager
from .core.result_aggregator import ResultAggregator
from .core.error_handler import ErrorHandler
from .core.feedback_loop import FeedbackLoop
```
These lines import FastAPI (the web framework) and all the core orchestration components from their respective modules. This sets up the building blocks for the orchestration workflow.

```python
app = FastAPI(title="Orchestration Agent API")
```
Creates a FastAPI application instance, giving it a descriptive title.

```python
# Instantiate core components
input_handler = InputHandler()
task_planner = TaskPlanner()
agent_dispatcher = AgentDispatcher()
state_manager = StateManager()
result_aggregator = ResultAggregator()
error_handler = ErrorHandler()
feedback_loop = FeedbackLoop()
```
Here, each core component is instantiated as an object. This modular approach allows each part of the workflow to be managed independently.

```python
@app.post("/orchestrate")
def orchestrate(mcp_acl_json: dict):
    """Main orchestration endpoint."""
    plan = input_handler.handle(mcp_acl_json)
    tasks = task_planner.plan(plan)
    results = agent_dispatcher.dispatch(tasks)
    aggregated = result_aggregator.aggregate(results)
    feedback_loop.log(aggregated)
    return aggregated
```
Defines the main API endpoint `/orchestrate` that accepts POST requests. When a request comes in:
- The input handler processes and validates the input.
- The task planner breaks the plan into tasks.
- The agent dispatcher sends tasks to sub-agents and collects results.
- The result aggregator combines the results.
- The feedback loop logs the outcome.
- The final aggregated result is returned to the client.

**Summary:**
This file ties together all the core orchestration components in a clear, step-by-step workflow, following Pythonic best practices: modularity, readability, and separation of concerns.

## Explanation of `requirements.txt`

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the Python packages your project depends on. This makes it easy for anyone to set up the same development environment by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**In this project, `requirements.txt` includes:**
- `fastapi`: The web framework used to build APIs for the orchestration agent and sub-agents.
- `pydantic`: Used for data validation and defining request/response models with type hints.
- `uvicorn`: A lightning-fast ASGI server for running FastAPI applications in development and production.

By keeping your dependencies in `requirements.txt`, you ensure your project is reproducible, easy to install, and beginner-friendly.

## How to Test the Backend (Step-by-Step)

You can easily test if your FastAPI backend is running and responding correctly by following these steps:

### 1. Start the FastAPI Server

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in your project directory and activate your virtual environment if you have one:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then run the orchestration agent (or any agent) with:

```
python -m uvicorn orchestration_agent.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Test the API Endpoint with `curl`

Open a new terminal window and run:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/orchestrate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{}"
```

- This sends an empty JSON object to the `/orchestrate` endpoint.
- If your endpoint expects specific fields, replace `{}` with the appropriate JSON payload, e.g.:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/orchestrate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"action\": \"test\"}"
```

### 3. Test with PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest`

If you prefer PowerShell, use:

```
$body = '{}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/orchestrate" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

### 4. Use the Interactive API Docs

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

You can test endpoints interactively from the Swagger UI.

### 5. Understanding the Response

A typical response might look like:

```
{"patient_journey":{},"disease_prediction":{},"errors":[]}
```

- `patient_journey` and `disease_prediction` are placeholders for agent results. They are empty if the agents return no data yet.
- `errors` is an array for error messages. An empty array means no errors occurred.

As you implement more logic, these fields will contain real results and error information as needed.

---

**Summary:**
- Start the server with `python -m uvicorn ...`
- Test with `curl`, PowerShell, or the browser
- Check the response for agent results and errors

This process ensures your backend is running and ready for further development or integration.
